# make-gene-list
This script will make a list of single gene partitions. It was designed to be used for PartitionFinder, but it also useful forother programs such as BaCoCa.

To create a list of partitions, run this script in a directory with single gene alignments in fasta format. As written, fasta files should have the extension ".fas", but this can easily be modified withing the script for your purposes.
